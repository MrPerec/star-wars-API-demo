This application for searching characters, ships and planets from Star Wars using the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/) with the ability to select a search category. 

In this application, I use fetch requests to get information about the characters, ships and planets of the star wars universe. After receiving, all information is displayed in a convenient form creating new elements. The code is divided into small modules that can be reused.
